## How to use
Before you begin, you may want to reboot the memory.
- Open settings and remove all memories and customization you may have set.
- Then prompt something like this: **“Forget what you know about me”** or get specific, like **“Forget my name”** or **“Forget our earlier conversation”**.
- You may also want to prompt: **"Also forget what I have said about you"**.
  
  
To initialize - just prompt:
- 💬 Here is my `CHAT-SETUP.md` — please use this as **the source of truth**.
- 📎 Drag-and-drop the file directly into the chat. CHAT will instantly re-sync.
  
  
After the initial setup, you can ask:
- **"What do you know about me?"**, or **"Who am I?**
- **"What do you know about yourself?"**, or **"Who are you?"**
- **"What do you call me, and what should I call you?"**
  
  
To update — just say something like:
- **“CHAT, remember this: ...”** and follow it with the info you want to save.
- **“Add this to your memory: ...”**
- **“Save this: ...”**
- For example: **"CHAT, remember this: I prefer Bootstrap over Tailwind."**
- You can also ask: **“What do you remember about me?”**
- **“Forget about: ...”**
- **“Update your memory with: ...”**

CHAT will confirm once it’s saved.
