# Emoji
###### A small digital image with a big responsibility.

An emoji is a small digital image or icon used to express an idea, emotion, or concept in electronic communication. Originating from Japan, the term "emoji" comes from the Japanese words "e" (絵) meaning "picture" and "moji" (文字) meaning "character." Emojis have become a universal language of sorts, transcending linguistic barriers and allowing people to convey emotions and ideas quickly and visually in text messages, social media, and other digital platforms.

Emojis can range from smiley faces and hearts to animals, food, activities, travel destinations, objects, symbols, and flags. They add color and personality to our digital conversations, making it easier to convey tone and emotion in a way that plain text sometimes can't.

As of now, there are over 3,500 emojis approved by the Unicode Consortium, which is the organization responsible for maintaining the standard set of emojis used across different platforms and devices. Emojis are constantly evolving, and new ones are added each year to keep up with cultural trends and user demand.
